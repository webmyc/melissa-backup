        If your pussy could talk, what would she say?
Have you ever asked her?
Are you familiar with how she looks?
What she likes?
How she likes to be touched?
Do you gaze at one of your most glorious parts of your body that is a major part of what makes you a woman?
“The Pussy Talks”
could be seen as confronting, yet it is also an astounding and honoring documentary where you have the opportunity to witness the voice of women through their
pussies.
Generally speaking, men are a lot more comfortable seeing their own and other men’s anatomy in real life, as it is easily on show in sports locker rooms and while standing next to one another at a urinal.
For women, it is the opposite - our beautiful P
ussies
are hidden underneath.
We don't see her unless we look for her.
And for the most part, we don't search her out.
We spend time doing our hair, criticizing our skin, watching our weight, and choosing what to wear, in order to attract another - so our Pussy can be “loved up” by another.
And when we do place attention on her, it is often to change her in order to make her more acceptable, as if she is not beautiful just as she is.
“
The Pussy Talks”
is a film that will astound you, humble you, and push you through a common taboo that rests around your own sexual anatomy.
By the end of the documentary, you will understand how every woman has a beautiful Pussy!
In this groundbreaking documentary, you will have the chance to view a wide variety of pussies and see how varied every woman’s pussy is.
In doing so you will realize how normal yours is.
It is actually criminal, and incredibly heartbreaking, how many women believe theirs is the ugly and unacceptable one.
This documentary will change you.
