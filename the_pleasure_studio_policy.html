        The Pleasure Studio Return Policy
Effective date: June 2022
On Purchase
Dear reader.
When you say YES, to you. Due to the custom nature of each experience, all sales are FINAL. If you purchase a payment plan, you are required to complete payment of the purchased program regardless of whether or not
you
complete the work. By completing the check out process you acknowledge that you understand and agree to these terms and conditions. Please ensure you are a
FULL BODY YES
, as there are no refunds.
Even more so, if you receive a customized offer that is extended to you through referrals, meeting in person at public events or the extension of coaching if your partner has or is already working with me.
I kindly request that you provide a minimum of 24 hours' notice if you need to cancel or reschedule your call. For clients on a monthly plan, please note that failing to provide the requested notice will result in the forfeiture of that scheduled session.Â I appreciate your understanding and cooperation.
And most of all I am both
excited and humbled
you have chosen this particular container to support you on
your journey
of sexual wellness which is a crucial factor of your overall health, wealth and well being.
