I have searched for years to connect with the perfect person and Melissa you are that person.
Your content is lightyears beyond my greatest expectations. In fact it is Unbelievable. I not only learned So Much about myself, but about you ladies as well.  You have managed to normalize everything in such a way that makes one feel comfortable with ones own truth.
There are not enough Thanks You's I can offer, as I got so much out of everything in this program.
Thank You! Thank You! Thank You! A Million, Gazillion times. Absolutely awesome.
So much gratitude to you Melissa.
Mathew
Melissa definitely is a pro at creating safe, fun and colourful spaces in which she holds her programs. I can say without a doubt that I would recommend her work to anybody and everybody who is looking to learn more of the arts of pleasure, satisfaction, connection, and love.
"Lover - Do you find yourself stuck in your head overthinking sex with your partner before it even starts?
The pressure to please, to perform, to ‘be the man’ weighing heavily in your heart as you avoid intimacy with any excuse possible.
You're analyzing, worrying, second-guessing.  Sex is supposed to feel good, but instead, it feels like a test you just can't get right.
You want to want her. You need to have sex as you crave the connection, but your body
or
c🐓ck just won’t respond.
Maybe It happens so damn fast that
the moment is over before she has even really starts to enjoy herself
and now you can’t look her in the eyes. You tell yourself you’ll do better next time, but the pressure just makes it worse.
Or maybe your a man always trying to finish,
but no matter how long you last, it’s like your body is stuck in limbo.
You know she is wondering if it’s her and that you are not attracted to her anymore. You know it is not that but you can’t explain it.
The effort feels exhausting, the frustration builds,
and sex starts to feel like a performance where you just don't get anywhere.
Or maybe it is like the switch has been turned off.  You use to feel the fire. The hunger. The craving. But not anymore and you don’t know why. It has been
sssooo long since you just had sex
with her any time, anywhere, anyhow. And this scares you.
She reaches for you, but you pull away avoiding intimacy as you make excuses
because the fear of failing again is worse than not trying at all.
Not because you don’t love her, but because you don’t know how to explain what’s happening.  And
with every rejection, you feel the distance between you growing
wider
. You feel her disappointment and worry if she thinks less of you.
The frustration, the embarrassment, the guilt—
it’s a cycle you can’t seem to break.
The worst part is you feel as if you’re letting both of you down as you ask again and again and again “What’s wrong with me?”
What if I told you it does not have to be this way ?
When you become a "Man In Control"
everything changes
YES I want that
Here are some facts.
…
Today the average man
lasts only 4 min
from penetration to ejaculation. A woman's body needs 30 -40 minutes to become fully aroused, turned on and orgasmic.
Constantly ejaculating
weakens a man's vitality.
Premature Ejaculation is a sign of our highly stressed times. It does not have to be the norm and
every man can change it.
Many acts of sex leave women feeling
dissatisfied and distant
from their partners.
A mans power lies in his ejaculation choice. Not just in the bedroom but in
all areas of his life.
Are you ready to take control of your life from the inside out?
Man in Control
is a powerful, no-nonsense, short yet content rich, 4 module program designed to have you
master your sexual energy
and develop
unshakable confidence
in and outside of the bedroom
Great lovers are not born.
They are made.
"
Sometimes I would come earlier than I wanted and other times I could not come when I wanted to.
All that changed
after five weeks of lessons from Melissa.

- Greg USA
Melissa's program is nothing short of beautiful.
Becoming more educated about my sexual energy has allowed me to better harness this power to increase my overall health, focus, and confidence.
For so long, I had taken part in unhealthy sexual practices
because I had never been taught by parents, society or friends, what a healthy sex life really looks like.  Something that Melissa said that has always stuck with me was that
"we are never taught how to be great lovers".
Melissa is the perfect teacher to help guide anyone on learning how to be that great lover!

In her field and in life
Melissa is one badass angel.
She has put my life on a whole new sexual and sensual trajectory for which I am eternally grateful

...

You master the power to choose when, how & with whom you ejaculate.
You experience so much more pleasure.
Your partner gets to experience her true orgasmic potential as you gift her the time to do so
Your masturbation practice fuels your body with energy instead of depleting it.
You have stronger erections
Your experience increased energy levels and a higher sex drive.
You become multi orgasmic
You make more money as you are harnessing sexual energy which is the creative energy of  all the geniuses.
You experience a deeper more satisfying connection to yourself and your partner
Melissa, my life is so good right now. in fact, mainly because of the new approach you’ve given me. Life is wonderful.
And it’s an even a more beautiful thing to have my wife in it with me, in my corner, my ride-or-die.
I recently took her on a sex-cation and using all that I have learned from you changed everything.
We experienced sex like we have not ever before. It was amazing.
Thank you for everything.
- Matt USA
Melissa brings a powerful mix of knowledge about relationships and our masculine energies,
combining medical understanding, cultural and spiritual philosophies, with straightforward anecdotes.
She explains things in ways that stick. Her work makes complex ideas feel approachable and meaningful, showing how our inner world shapes our confidence, lovemaking, and connections with others.
- Sven  Denmark
Working with Melissa did more for our marriage than marital counselling.
If I had coaching with Melissa when I was in my 20’s
it could have spared me a lot of fights and misunderstandings.

When I asked my wife the difference between sex before my coaching with Melissa compared to now.  She said, “It went from a good sprint to a marathon.”

I'm Melissa Louise

I
was hired by the owners of Penthouse in Sydney to teach their ladies how to make a man last longer so they would make more money! And they did.
As an Erotic Blueprint coach and your Pleasure Advocate
I am here to emancipate men from their deep shame & insecurities when it comes to the bedroom. So they can own and harness the power of their cock so not only do they become the man who fucks his woman wide open, through her mind, heart and pussy but also the man that is more trustworthy, powerful and knows more freedom by fully embodying his life rooted in his mission.
In my work I combine Tantric, Daoist & Kink 101 teachings, as well as bringing my knowledge as a Conscious Breathwork facilitator,  Accelerated Evolution coach and trainings in Access Consciousness into the sexy mix.
Above all, I am an intuitive coach and healer.
An embodiment of the deepest feminine gift, “The felt sense”
It is time to stop shying away
from your greatness.
Know that your super power begins with
ejaculation choice.
