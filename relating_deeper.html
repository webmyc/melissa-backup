        DEEPER RELATING
with Melissa Louise
I’m not sure words can sum up this wonderful woman! My husband and I have been having sessions with Melissa for over a month now and the changes within ourselves and our relationship is phenomenal! The connection to self, connection to each other is all back baby! Let’s not forget the LOVE and understanding Melissa has helped us foster within ourselves, for each other and for our family! Her knowledge is delicious, always leaving you wanting more as it just makes SENSE & speaks to all the fibres of your being.

Hello Lover. I am your Sensuous Pleasure Advocate, Erotic Blue Print, Sex, Intimacy, & Relationship Expert and t
his is my invitation to you and your beloved to embark on an intimate journey into the deeper and more sensual corners of your relationship.
The quality of your intimate relationship is deeply intertwined with the fabric of your overall quality of life and is a fundamental aspect of your human nature. This relationship is your truest mirror that reflects your deepest needs, desires, and aspects of your true self which is why the dedication to its cultivation is of the utmost importance to your health, wealth and wellbeing.
Deeper Relating
which is my signature program previously only available to my private clients is an incredible framework to do just that. This program is inspired by the truth that t
he quality of your relationships profoundly influences the overall quality of your life.
Deeper Relating is where you experience profound practices that foster and cultivate more connection, deeper honesty, trust building vulnerability, more safety and of course.....
hotter sex.
If this is what you want, then...
Join here!
It is not about wether you are in a relationship or not, but rather it is more importantly about the
quality
of relationship you are in.
This
lover
is your invitation to
deepen
and
magnify
the quality of yours.
DEEPER
RELATING
Do you crave to
connect more intimately
with your beloved?
Has life gotten in the way, and you find yourself feeling guilty that work and/or the kids have come between you and your partner, and the sexy has taken a back seat?
Are you looking for ways to
bring back the spark
that was there when you first met?
Are you
wondering where your libido has gone
and worry that it is going to be like this from now on?
Are you
struggling to even connect with one another
, where old hurts, building resentments and unsaid words are getting in the way?
Do you find yourself exasperated and a little lost when it comes to knowing how to approach the topics you desperately want to talk about
but fear rejection from your beloved?
Do you find yourselves constantly fighting about the same things over and over again without resolution and
feeling stuck
in the damaging loop of bickering?
If you answered yes to any of these then Lover, I've got you.
Are you ready to experience the kind of pleasure, love, and connection that you often daydream about? Do you feel it is high time to learn communication tools that support you to have those difficult (and sometimes tricky) conversations that actually create a closer connection between the two of you? Does your relationship deserve to be nourished by the two fo you having gourmet sex once again? If so then
Deeper Relating
is definitely for you.
"For our first session, Melissa created a very safe space for both of us to be vulnerable, and helped us to reveal parts of ourselves that needed so desperately to be shared, which is really saying something, as my partner and I have been in love for 8 years and we communicate & “dive deep” together as it is.
It was incredible to have Melissa there to push the envelope of vulnerability and sharing… she reminded us that our pleasure is our own right and responsibility, not each other’s, and also provided us with practical ways to work through our own healing and our relationship, creating more space for love/sex/magic in the chaos of the world. Having practical advice for pleasurable experiences in life is possible, and Melissa provided us with this and so much more.
I’ve been singing her praises to my girlfriends, and even my guy friends, and I really believe that this powerhouse woman’s insights could change the world as we know it.”
-Sarafina Fornara (Scottsdale, AZ)
To experience epic sex, which is the fundamental foundation and glue of what holds together deeply successful intimate relationships, you need to be cultivating an environment that is rooted in love, safety, and belonging.
This program is not about a list of tricks and positions to try in bed (although YES!.. there are a few of those as well!)
It is a deep and provocative journey into the inner fabric of your relating
where lies the depth of your vulnerability, desire, sensuality, courage and playfulness.
The truth is that
the health of your intimate relationship profoundly affects your happiness, resilience, and even your growth as an individual. The fulfillment derived from a deeply meaningful, intimate relationship fuels your sense of belonging, purpose, and satisfaction in life. Thus, investing time and attention in the well-being of your intimate relationship is essential, as it leads to a life enriched with emotional and psychological well-being
Deeper Relating
is the perfect program if you are currently feeling disconnected to your beloved and are wanting to nourish your connection once again.
Deeper Relating
is the perfect program if you and your beloved are in a good place, but want something a little more. Something deeper to keep the juice flowing and the foundation inspired and strong.
Deeper Relating
is the place where you will learn many different techniques and practices that have been tried and tested by myself and my clients over the past 11 years proving their effectiveness in opening us with care and courage to levels of safety, belonging, love, and pleasure that you may not realize are possible, yet deeply crave.
If you are wanting to experience a deeper love in your partnership, have more curiosity towards the places you have not explored yet, feel safe and confident while doing so, and feel your body ache for your partner once again, then...
