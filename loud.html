L O U D
Movement for the soul & nervous system.
An intimate, in-person and virtual experience for those who desire to go deep and allow the waves of emotion to offer a cleansing alchemy through the energy of
primal rage.
The LOUD method is a combination of
somatic movement therapy, nervous system release techniques, and sound and breath work
to address and release the deep physiological effects of trauma in the mind and body.
Due to the
overwhelming emotional pain that is often congruent with trauma,
it is common that post-traumatic stress remains in the body, stifling the healing process.
By experiencing these feelings, layer by layer,
in the comfort of a safe container,
we are able to thaw the symptoms of the often avoided innate responses that get stored in the body and nervous system.
Empowering ourselves
through this process, we are able to connect the body with its powerful self-healing functions which assist in resolving intense states of stress, deep emotional release, physical tension, and trauma.
RAGE creates boundaries.
RAGE destructs all that is not true.
RAGE transforms.

Meet your facilitators:
Infinity
I truly know what it means to go from being numb and playing within the confining social constructs of suppressed emotions and false personas to actually feeling it all.
It took my life falling apart, having brain surgery, and losing my tech start-up and all of my money to begin to unravel and start to FEEL again.
It was through this transformation that I committed to never abandoning myself or pimping my energy for the benefit of the patriarchy any longer.
I went back to the basics, I slowed down, I learned to take care of my nervous system, my health, and how to be quiet and listen.
It is from this place where
L O U D
was born.
Melissa Louise
As your leading Pleasure Advocate, Erotic Blueprint, Sex Intimacy & Relationship Coach, Melissa knows that one of the major factors holding people back from
claiming their orgasmic pleasure
is the denial of all their emotions.
Especially anger and rage.
She supports her clients worldwide in the yoga of anger addressing the charge of trauma.
We can not move to bliss when we are holding the density of what is stifling us.
If you are ready to know this kind of freedom then join us for L O U D here.
