I support women to reclaim their divine birthright to feel alive, orgasmic & turned the fuck on, no matter what their age or relationship status.
Have you given up on having the pleasure-filled relationship you desire?
Do you somehow believe you are broken?
Do you feel disillusioned with society's narrative that sexiness and turn-on are only for the maiden?
Do you feel exhausted, burnt out, and fed up with the way you are expected to work and live?
Struggling to find time for your own pleasure?
If you are wanting more connection and pleasure in your life and are ready to be satisfied, fulfilled, and excited by your sex life no matter what your age or relationship status then let’s get on a call and see if we are a good fit to work together.

I look forward to speaking with you.
Your pleasure is your birthright and you are made for it.
Physically, Spiritually, and Emotionally.
Always with pleasure,

What others are saying about working with me:
"Working with Melissa has been such a game changer for me.
Upon receiving all of the knowledge, empathy, and love she departed in our sessions, I am in awe at what large a component of my self-work I can
now explore thanks to her wisdom. Doors have been opened!
There is so much to know and embody within our sexuality that just isn't shared in a widespread fashion (yet), and I am so grateful to have found
a teacher; someone to help me to learn to break boundaries
of healing with magic and manifestation.
WOW. Can't wait to work with you again, Melissa, thank you so much!"
- Kate, Australia
"Working with Melissa was life-changing not just for my relationship, but also for myself. She guided with understanding, compassion, and fun. I didn't think this level of transformation was possible,
but it
truly has opened up my heart and mind to what is possible."
- Sonya
"I just wanted to let you know I am so grateful to the universe that put you on our path. The coaching sessions with you were so powerful and life-changing! After a rocky and sexless few years with my husband, where my heart was
closed and emasculation was frequent...
Then I met you...
You heard me, held me, and taught me about men.
About my self-healing and how to reach pleasure as my north! I am now more
attuned to me, my man, and my surroundings. I am fuller and happier! Thank you!
Thank you so much for your love and for sharing your wisdom.
Love you."
- Shari, England
