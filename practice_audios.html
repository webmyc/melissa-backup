        Follow Along Practice Audios to Last Longer in Bed
Yes I want that
Jim England
I used to panic the second I felt myself getting close,
and that anxiety just made things worse.
These audios completely changed how I experience sex.
The breathing and kegel techniques gave me actual control over my stamina, and for the first time, I feel confident knowing I can last as long as I want.
My partner has noticed a huge difference
and so have I.
Thank god I found Melissa when I did.
Edward Ireland
I had tried everything from reading articles, watching videos, even taking supplements, but none of that stuff actually helped me last longer.
This training was different.
It walked me through exactly what to do step by step, and within weeks, I could feel a real change. No more frustration or feeling
disappointed in myself.  Instead I just feel my full presence and control. It is so awesome.
Most men struggle with stamina in bed, but only a few actually do something about it.
If you’re tired of hoping it gets better on its own, this is your answer.
These step-by-step audios will train your body, your breath, and your plea
sure response
so you can last longer, stay harder, and take charge of your performance—like a man who knows exactly what he’s doing. Are you ready to level up?
There’s no shortage of information on lasting longer in bed, but let’s be real—reading about it won’t change anything. Most courses throw a bunch of concepts at you and expect you to figure it out on your own. You need to train your body, not just fill your head with information.
I am sure you have heard the advice—"Do your kegels," "Control your breath," "Be more present"—but no one actually shows you how. What you need is clear, step-by-step training that teaches your body exactly how to build stamina, control arousal, and stay present in the moment.
This isn’t just theory or vague tips; these audios walk you through each technique, guiding you in real-time so you can actually feel the difference.
Mastering stamina and control isn’t just about knowing what to do. It is about doing it, consistently, with the right techniques. That’s why real-time, guided instruction is the key to real results.
Most men don’t struggle because they lack knowledge. They struggle because they’ve never been shown how to apply it in the moment. This training bridges that gap, taking you from theory to mastery.

YES I want that
Here are some facts.
…
Today the average man
lasts only 4 min
from penetration to ejaculation. A woman's body needs 30 -40 minutes to become fully aroused, turned on and orgasmic.
Constantly ejaculating
weakens a man's vitality.
Premature Ejaculation is a sign of our highly stressed times. It does not have to be the norm and
every man can change it.
Many acts of sex leave women feeling
dissatisfied and distant
from their partners.
A mans power lies in his ejaculation choice. Not just in the bedroom but in
all areas of his life.
If you are ready to do the practical steps whilst listening to my voice as I guide you step by step, then i can say there is no more inspiring way to do so than getting these audios.
Great lovers are not born.
They are made.
I used to psych myself out before sex even started. The pressure to perform would get in my head, and that stress only made things worse.
These audios rewired the way I approach intimacy.
The exercises helped me build stamina and confidence, and now, for the first time in my life,
I feel in control
instead of anxious
- Anthony New Zealand
Before practicing with these audios, sex always felt like I was in a race against time. I’d be in my head, worried about finishing too soon, and I couldn’t fully enjoy the moment.
They taught me how to slow down, control my pleasure, and actually be present with my partner.
Now, I last longer, and sex has become more intimate and connected than ever before.
- Jason USA
I thought lasting longer was just about willpower, but the training in these audiso showed me it’s actually a skill.
The combination of breathing, kegels, and learning my ‘point of no return’ completely changed the game.
Now I can control my arousal instead of it controlling me, and the pleasure I feel has never been better. I had heard about this kind of thing before but was not so sure it was real, but now I get it

When I asked my wife the difference between sex before my coaching with Melissa compared to now.  She said, “It went from a good sprint to a marathon.”

I
was hired by the owners of Penthouse in Sydney to teach their ladies how to make a man last longer so they would make more money! And they did.
As an Erotic Blueprint coach and your Pleasure Advocate
I am here to emancipate men from their deep shame & insecurities when it comes to the bedroom. So they can own and harness the power of their cock so not only do they become the man who fucks his woman wide open, through her mind, heart and pussy but also the man that is more trustworthy, powerful and knows more freedom by fully embodying his life rooted in his mission.
In my work I combine Tantric, Daoist & Kink 101 teachings, as well as bringing my knowledge as a Conscious Breathwork facilitator,  Accelerated Evolution coach and trainings in Access Consciousness into the sexy mix.
Above all, I am an intuitive coach and healer.
An embodiment of the deepest feminine gift, “The felt sense”
If you’re ready to master your stamina, build unshakable confidence, and take charge of your pleasure with proven, step-by-step training, then this is for you.
It’s time to show up differently. It’s time to take control.
