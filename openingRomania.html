        OPENING Romania
The Divine Tapestry of Your Feminine Mystery
A Weekend of Your Sensual Unfolding
for Women
Bra»ôov, Romania ‚Ä¢ 12th & 13th April 2025
"A woman‚Äôs beauty is not in her body alone, but in the way she moves through the world‚Äîlike the ocean, like the wind, like a whisper of the divine."
here!
‚ú® This is your invitation to a two-day intimate gathering for women ready to radiate. ‚ú®
A Sacred & Playful Journey into Your Divine Feminine Nature
Beloved One,
There‚Äôs a whisper in your heart. A gentle tugging that says there‚Äôs more‚Äî
more to feel, more to experience, more to become.
Can you hear it?
Do you notice it?
Maybe you‚Äôve felt it when you catch your reflection in the mirror.
Or in those quiet moments when you wonder what it would feel like to truly
celebrate
being in your body, your sensuality, your power.
OPENING is my sacred invitation for you to listen to that whisper.
Are you a woman who is‚Ä¶
Curious about feminine embodiment but unsure where to begin?
Feeling called to explore your sensual nature in a safe, nurturing space?
Tired, exhausted, or frustrated by feeling disconnected from your body and desires?
Ready to meet yourself in the mirror with love, not criticism?
Longing for real, authentic connection with other women on a similar journey?
Tired of chasing an ever-distant
"enough"
‚Äî
Of measuring
your beauty, your brilliance, your magic
against invisible lines...
If you have bent, softened, or
silenced parts of yourself
to fit a world that never truly sees the depth of you‚Äî
Then
OPENING
is your invitation.
A gathering of all you are. A remembering.
Step into a space where you are not only
enough
‚Äî but
seen and celebrated
for all of you.
Reserve Your Spot Here
During these two days of workshops, you will have the opportunity to truly meet, release, and transform the old paradigm‚Äîone that has left you feeling stifled, suffocated, and stuck in a place that no longer serves you or those around you.
The truth is, you are meant to exist in your
incredible divine expression.
In ancient times, women gathered in temples to:
Honor their
cyclical nature
Celebrate their
sensual wisdom
Share their
sacred knowledge
Support
each other's awakening
OPENING recreates this
temple space
in modern times.
In this sacred container, you'll:
Release old stories about your
worth and beauty
Access your
natural sensual wisdom
Understand the dance
of masculine and feminine energy
Create unshakeable
inner sovereignty
Connect with your
body's innate knowing
This isn't about pushing boundaries or forcing transformation. OPENING is an unfolding invitation to:
Explore at
your own pace
Honour your
comfort
levels
Find your
unique expression
of feminine energy
Connect with other women
in a non-judgmental space
Discover what
sensual embodiment means for YOU
*
"Being a woman means embracing the tides within, the ebbs and flows of nature, and the moon‚Äôs whispers in our blood."
‚Äî Nikita Gill
*
By the simple truth of your existence, your birthright is to fully embody and express all that you are in your entirety.
There is no time for ‚Äúwaiting‚Äù.
As a woman you are the wild sensuous nature of being.
Whether you walk this earth single or partnered, the union of your inner world is your power.
Say Yes To YOU Now Gorgeous Woman

Melissa is a deeply loving woman with so much lived wisdom.
The profound and powerful, no BS female wisdom I see and experience from her work and conversation comes from her actual life experience. She fought for her right and power, and fully embodies it.
It has been inspiring to spend time with her.
The teachers whom¬†Melissa brought together for the workshops during the retreat were all so professional, respectful and loving.
I cannot describe the genuineness
of each teacher I got to work with. They cared so deeply about women, and had such wisdom about the healing we need deep inside.
Each workshop was life changing for me.
It was indeed a co-creation with all the women participating in the retreat. It was a very magical space.
Mandy¬†~ USA
Melissa‚Äùs retreat was so much more than any ‚Äòretreat‚Äô I‚Äôve seen advertised or attended in the past.
It was an experience of the senses from the moment we were greeted at the airport and whisked away to a massage,
followed by a champagne welcome with the other epic women on this adventure and then to a delectable dinner in the quaint town of Puerto Vallarta.
Each day and evening was filled with sensual yummines rolled up in savvy sophistication, and of course, FUN!
Melissa took care of my every need and made me feel held & supported like I have craved for many years ‚Äì
healing and expansion are actually able to flourish in this type of environment!

Meet Your Guide
Melissa Louise
is a Leading Pleasure Advocate, Erotic Blueprint Coach, & Sex, Intimacy & Relationship Expert.
A
passionate advocate
for the decriminalization of human sexuality, Melissa believes that
every person has the birthright to receive true, sacred, and guilt-free sexual and menstrual education
. Her core message?
"Our pleasure is NOT optional."
Melissa‚Äôs mission is to shift the shame, fear, and misinformation surrounding sexuality‚Äîdeeply ingrained beliefs that limit our access to one of our most life-changing gifts:
our own sexual energy.
Her work is rooted in
reclaiming health, wealth, and well-being
, all of which are intrinsically connected to our relationship with sensuality and sexuality. She empowers women to
reclaim their divine birthright
, to feel alive, orgasmic, and unapologetically turned on‚Äî
regardless of age or relationship status.
Melissa is often described as a
"badass in her field,"
blending boldness with deep compassion. She works with both men and women, helping them unlock their fullest sensual potential.
Wendy¬†~ USA
No words can really express the amount of
gratitude and love
I feel from the glorious experience
I had at Melissa‚Äôs recent retreat!
I want to express the pure joy and deep fellowship I felt holding space with all those amazing women who attended. I was at times stretched to my limits, but
always so surprised at the amount of love and compassion I felt from you
, the ladies and even the gentlemen who helped do the "stretching".
I was brought to tears seeing how intimacy and love do not necessarily have to be sexual. I learned SO MUCH.
This retreat truly was the example of the embodiment of being a QUEEN.
"D"¬†~ Vancouver
The array of workshops on offer are profound.
This remarkable woman as a leader invites us to
experience a sensory journey that not only provides a sense of therapeutic release but also brings a sense of awakening of receptivity .
I‚Äôm feeling a greater awareness of
the type of energy that I want in my life
and that I want to project .
Melissa is a genius¬†in integrating a sense of
wholeness and connection
