        SURRENDER
A Sacred Invitation to the Woman Who is Ready for her own divine led truth.
Saturday 1st March 3pm EET - Online
here!
Gorgeous woman. To surrender is not to submit. It is not to collapse. It is not to give yourself away.
True feminine surrender is an opening—an unguarded exhale into life itself.
For too long, we have been taught that surrender is weakness. That letting go means losing control. That trusting invites betrayal. Yet, the deepest truth is this:
Surrender is the gateway to your power.
Not power over—but power within.
This is your invitation to a transformational 3-hour event, where you will be guided through three profound initiations of surrender.
This is for the woman who desires to feel deep trust—in herself, in life, and in love.
Before she can fully surrender in the presence of a man, she must first feel the truth of surrender within her own body.
What You Will Experience
This immersive experience will take you through three sacred processes designed to open you into deeper trust and feminine embodiment:
1.
Surrender to the truth felt in your body:
Before we can trust ourselves, we must feel ourselves. In this process, we will somatically move through the four core emotions—anger, sadness, fear, and joy—liberating them from the body so that we can hear the deeper wisdom beneath them. This is where you reclaim yourself, where you stop performing for the world and begin listening to the deepest truth within.
2.
Surrender to HER: The Universe:
How safe do you feel being held by others? How deeply do you trust the world around you? The process of life itself?  In this practice, we explore the wounds and stories we carry around trusting other women, and how they impact our ability to surrender to the existence of life. To open to love, abundance, and divine flow, we must first heal the fractures of sisterhood and belonging.
3.
Surrender to the innate intelligence of your power:
Finding Safety in Your Full Expression Power is not force. Power is not domination. True power is the ability to stand fully in your truth, unapologetically, and still feel safe. In this process, you will meet your edges, feel your full expression, and cultivate the deep nervous system safety required to trust yourself at your most powerful.
Who is This For?
This is for the woman who:
✨ Feels like she is holding onto control so tightly that she cannot breathe.
✨ Desires to feel safe in her softness, her emotions, and her power.
✨ Knows she is ready to trust herself and trust life more deeply.
✨ Feels the call to open, soften, and surrender—without losing herself.

Melissa is a deeply loving woman with so much lived wisdom.
The profound and powerful, no BS female wisdom I see and experience from her work and conversation comes from her actual life experience.
She fought for her right and power, and fully embodies it. It has been inspiring to spend time with her
Deanna ~ USA
I've done several of Melissa's offerings and always come away feeling so much more knowledgable and totally inspired.
Her work not only teaches women how to increase pleasure, but she
demonstrates how deeply important our emotional and spiritual self-care is and how this is connected to our pleasure.
The environment she creates. is incredibly supportive and nurturing that is safe for women to ask questions and share stories if they like, without feeling embarrassed.
If you have an opportunity to experience this class, encourage you to do it!

Simone ~ London
Through Melissa's coaching, I have found so much balance and harmony within my self. I have learned more than I could ever write. My confidence in my wisdom, my spirit and in my body has way surpassed any expectations I ever had of myself, since working with her
I can now trust my intuition,my cycle, do sex magic, download messages straight from spirit and enjoy pleasure in my body like never before.
I own and have power over my sexuality and it gives me so much life!
This is all thanks to Melissa opening up the doorway, her care and attention, her love, her passion and her ability to to hold space with no judgement were all incredibly healing and inspiring.
I've learned so much from her and the lessons continue, even after the coaching has ended. I still find nuggets of wisdom from her in the back of my mind.
If you're thinking if working with her, you certainly wont regret it, she is pure passion, sass and magic!
