Men
Are you ready to understand once and for all how to last longer in bed, and to have erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation issues as things of the past?
Take me there NOW!
Lover, let me ask you this...
Are you tired of ...
✘ Avoiding intimacy because you believe you can’t truly satisfy your partner?
✘ Feeling anxious, self-conscious, or incompetent sexually?
✘ Feeling disappointed that you came too quickly again?
✘ Not dating because you feel you may not live up to what you believe she wants in bed?
✘ Hearing yet another excuse from your partner as she avoids sex or intimacy with you again?
✘ Knowing that you're not living up to what is your true potential sexually?
Are you ready to take the action that will change this for you?
If so, then my
Occupy Your Cock Masterclass
is for you.
When a man knows how to use the superpower that is his sexual energy, he is able to supercharge his entire life.
Learning to last longer in bed ripples out to your relationships, your business, your creative projects, and your health.
When you stay stuck in the loop of sexual issues such as premature ejaculation (PE) & erectile dysfunction (ED), you are effectively a man that is shying away from life and not stepping into your true power.
This, lover, is truly emasculating.
Stepping out of this is easier than most believe.
You do not need to live in an ashram for years or remove yourself from desire to reach the goal of sexual mastery.
Inside my
Occupy Your Cock Masterclass
, I will be sharing the practical steps that all my clients have used to shift from not wanting to even undress and get jiggy with their lovers, to fully taking the lead in their relationships, while lasting for as long as they want.
Your power lies in your ejaculation choice.
You just have to take the action. Yes, that means you will have to masturbate a lot.
The difference is that I teach men how to masturbate well and separate their ejaculation from their orgasm.
You see, it is not that masturbation is the problem.
It is the way you masturbate and the fact you ejaculate each and every single time.
Are you a man of action?
If so,
Join here.
Are you ready to know more freedom, lover?
Do you want to be...
✔ Free from the anxiety of not being able to take her there?
✔ Free from the worry that you can last as long as she needs?
✔ Free from the concern that you won’t be able to please her?
✔ Free from the disappointment that keeps you from having the confidence you need as a man to make the difference the world that you want to?
Lover, you
deserve
to have the confidence that carries you through from the bedroom to the boardroom.
How we do sex is how we do
life
.
How you show up for
yourself in the bedroom
is how you are showing up for
yourself in life
.
Are you a
fuck yes
to showing up for yourself and your confidence?
Join us here.
Erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation is on the rise like never before.
There are reports upon reports and articles upon articles all about how men are lasting less and less in bed.
Yet not many of us are truly teaching men what to do about it.
Mastering your sexual energy is a skill.
Just like learning any other skill.
It is not rocket science.
But it does take practice.
If you're a man that is thinking that everyone else is able to have rock-hard erections and last a long time whilst you are one of the few that can’t, well, you are wrong.
Many men are just like you.
Yet you can be one of the few that actually does something about it.
Men of action are sexy as f*ck.

Meet your Master Coach,
Melissa Louise.
One of my claims to fame is that I was hired by the owners of
Penthouse in Sydney
18 years ago to teach their girls how to make a man last longer so they would make more money !!!
And they did !!
I have been supporting men to understand the power and gift of their sexual energy ever since.
I am a rebel, a world traveler, and I live life on my own terms.
I am here to emancipate men from their deep shame and insecurities when it comes to the bedroom.
So they can own and harness the power of their cock so not only do they
become the man who fucks his woman wide open, through her mind, heart, and pussy,
but also the man that is
more trustworthy, powerful, and knows more freedom
by fully embodying his life rooted in his mission.
As an Erotic Blueprint Coach combining Tantric, Daoist, and Kink 101 teachings, I also bring my knowledge as a conscious breathwork facilitator,  Accelerated Evolution coach, and training in Access consciousness.
Above all, I am an intuitive coach and healer.
An embodiment of the deepest feminine gift, “the felt sense.”
My coaching brings you into the divine union of the masculine and feminine where you get to experience your sexual relationship as the place that nourishes you, not depletes you.
My mission is to support men to know love to have purpose and to be a legend.
At least in the bedroom that is.
I have taught and spoken at public events in 8 different countries while supporting clients from all over the world with a 98% success rate.
I make sure my clients that are willing to put in the work get what they want.
What others are saying about me...
Jonny, England
After working with Melissa for just a couple of weeks, she helped me to get clear on shedding my toxic (British) definitions of masculinity and how I had been depriving my partner of my full primal self...
The evening after our second session felt like a real revelation and led to one of our biggest relationship breakthroughs—realizing how we had both been so conditioned by our families and upbringing to be 'NICE' rather than real, raw, truthful, wild and alive with each other—and needless to say this new way of being led to some passionate and powerful experiences in the bedroom!
Bill, USA
Melissa is an amazing fountain of knowledge with an amazing heart.  She is excellent at adapting her coaching to your needs.  The coaching she provides is truly life-changing.
I am a better man in so many ways because of Melissa.  Her coaching was so transformational in my life that I signed one of my adult sons up for coaching with her and intend to sign my other adult son up as well.
Connor, USA
Melissa's program is nothing short of beautiful.
Becoming more educated about my sexual energy has allowed me to better harness this power to increase my overall health, focus, and confidence.
Melissa is the perfect teacher to help guide anyone on learning how to be that great lover!
The program is LOADED with content and I would highly recommend it to absolutely anyone!   Let Melissa be your guide on your sexual journey, you will not regret it.
Thibaut, France
I can only use two words to describe my coaching experience with Melissa: Life-changing.
With Melissa's help, I have been able to completely express myself and express my desires to help people with their sexuality and be a part to end the taboo era around Sex.
As soon as I met her, I instantly felt the power and the potential of her communication and of her message.
Richard, Costa Rica / USA
In her field and in life Melissa is one badass angel. She has put my life on a whole new sexual and sensual trajectory for which I am eternally grateful.”
“I was working through some childhood trauma on allowing myself to receive from the feminine and pleasure. I knew the right person had come into my life.
