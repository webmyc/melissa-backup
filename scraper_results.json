She sees everyone with a caring, curious and passionate eye and listens with her heart backed by tremendous wisdom, experience, and presence that far exceeds one lifetime. Her intuition is profound and her ability to transform every moment into a sense of play transforms everything into a paradigm. She honors the old stories while playfully, sensually inviting and celebrating the new one creating a new reality and sense of self.\nShe guided me to open up new pathways of pleasure, receptivity and presence helping me understand, love, honor and more deeply connect to my beautiful masculine energy, sexuality, and body.\nFor Couples\nThere is a very misguided idea that sex should just \u201chappen\u201d and come naturally once we are in a relationship.\nBut nothing could be further from the truth.\nIs the connection ( or lack of ) in your relationship draining you or is it fueling you?\nThe true purpose of a relationship is to nourish, heal and create greatness with your connection, intimacy, and sex at the core. Not as an afterthought, memory, or hope.\nJust as we accept that other significant areas in our lives such as career, fitness, health, and spirituality need our time and attention turned towards them for continued evolution, the sexual & intimate connection between oneself and partner is so often left on the shelf.\nThe one thing that started your union is placed in the background.\nIt is so common and too often accepted.\nMore Information Here!\nIf you are wanting to dip your toes in you can check out my self-paced evergreen course for couples,\n\"\nDeeper Relating\n\"\nJoin Here\nMelissa created a very safe space for both of us to be vulnerable and helped us to reveal parts of ourselves that needed so desperately to be shared, which is really saying something, as my partner and I have been in love for 8 years and we communicate & \u201cdive deep\u201d together as it is, so it was incredible to have Melissa there to push the envelope of vulnerability and sharing.\nShe reminded us that our pleasure is our own right and responsibility- not each others, and also provided us with practical ways to work through our own healing and our relationship, creating more space for love/sex/magic in the chaos of the world. Having practical advice for pleasurable experiences in life is possible, and Melissa provided us with this and so much more. I\u2019ve been singing her praises to my girlfriends, and even my guy friends and I really believe that this powerhouse woman\u2019s insights could change the world as we know it - through self-empowerment, mastering our orgasm, prioritizing our pleasure and diving deeper into our own mind/body/soul\u2019s connection.\u201d\n-Sarafina & Garrett (Scottsdale, AZ)\nCrystal ~ Canada\nAfter removing my hormonal IUD I lost my orgasm! It totally died and my vagina felt dead. Then I found Melissa. Hiring her for 3 months was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve ever made. She helped me get my orgasm BACK!!!!\nAfter 3 months I\u2019m celebrating steamy nights in the sack with my hubby... with back-arching orgasms again. But she helped me in far more ways than just my sex life.\nShe\u2019s helped me get success in my business decisions, how to speak to men PROPERLY\u00a0 To get them to love worshiping and supporting me, and be a better mom to my boys. I had revelation after revelation during my sessions with Melissa.\nAaron ~ Ecstatic OYC Graduate\n\"First off, I want to say that anything Melissa puts out is brilliant! Since discovering her work, my life has changed in ways that were unexpected. Her Occupy Your C*ck course is the creme de la creme of all her programs\nIt has caused me to \"burn the fucking couch\" and rebuild my life from the ground up and to not only hold, but own that Masculine edge, allowing me to forge a life step by step that continues to amaze me to this day\nBefore you do anything else, get unto this program, be transformed and then you can pass GO, collect your $200 and make your world the playground of the Gods!\"\nSimone ~ UK\nThrough Melissa's coaching, I have found so much balance and harmony within myself. I have learned more than I could ever write. My confidence in my wisdom, my spirit, and in my body has way surpassed any expectations I ever had of myself, since working with her I can now trust my intuition and my cycle, do sex magic, download messages straight from spirit, and enjoy pleasure in my body like never before.\u00a0 I own and have power over my sexuality and it gives me so much life!\nThis is all thanks to Melissa opening up the doorway, her care and attention, her love, her passion, and her ability to hold space with no judgment were all incredibly healing and inspiring.\nI've learned so much from her and the lessons continue, even after the coaching has ended. I still find nuggets of wisdom from her in the back of my mind. If you're thinking of working with her, you certainly won't regret it, she is pure passion, sass, and magic!\nTake a peek here\nInterested in juicy, intimate pleasure tips and sweet freebies?\nWOMEN's\njoin my newsletter here at get my free video on the 3 most important truths about your pleasure.\nGender\nFemale\nSubmit\nInterested in juicy, intimate pleasure tips and sweet freebies?\nMEN's\njoin my newsletter here and get my free video all about the 8 different types of orgasms available to you.\nGender\nMale\nFemale\nSubmit\nAbout Me\nOne of my claims to fame is that I\nwas hired by the owners of Penthouse in Sydney 18 yrs ago to teach their girls how to make a man last longer so they would make more money!\nWhich they did.\nI Support and guide my clients using ancient Daoist and tantric techniques, Revolutionary Erotic Blueprint work and Accelerated Evolution processes so they can live a vibrant and sensual filled life.\nI am here to\u00a0 decriminalize human sexuality and shatter the often dangerous veil surrounding sexuality, intimacy and our bodies so that everyone has access to true, sacred, guilt-free sexual and menstrual education.\nNow more than ever, we need to shift the shame, fear and deeply compromised attitudes and information that heavily burden our most precious and life-changing gift: sex.\nThis is our true road to freedom..\nWE ARE NOT PROBLEMS TO FIX.

In fact it is Unbelievable. I not only learned So Much about myself, but about you ladies as well.\u00a0 You have managed to normalize everything in such a way that makes one feel comfortable with ones own truth.\nThere are not enough Thanks You's I can offer, as I got so much out of everything in this program.\nThank You! Thank You! Thank You! A Million, Gazillion times. Absolutely awesome.\nSo much gratitude to you Melissa.\nMathew\nMelissa definitely is a pro at creating safe, fun and colourful spaces in which she holds her programs. I can say without a doubt that I would recommend her work to anybody and everybody who is looking to learn more of the arts of pleasure, satisfaction, connection, and love.\n\"Lover - Do you find yourself stuck in your head overthinking sex with your partner before it even starts?\nThe pressure to please, to perform, to \u2018be the man\u2019 weighing heavily\u00a0in your heart as you avoid intimacy with any excuse possible.\nYou're analyzing, worrying, second-guessing.\u00a0 Sex is supposed to feel good, but instead, it feels like a test you just can't get right.\nYou want to want her. You need to have sex as you crave the connection, but your body\nor\nc\ud83d\udc13ck just won\u2019t respond.\nMaybe It happens so damn fast that\nthe moment is over before she has even really starts to enjoy herself\nand now you can\u2019t look her in the eyes. You tell yourself you\u2019ll do better next time, but the pressure just makes it worse.\nOr maybe your a man always trying to finish,\nbut no matter how long you last, it\u2019s like your body is stuck in limbo.\nYou know she is wondering if it\u2019s her and that you are not\u00a0attracted to her anymore. You know it is not that\u00a0but you can\u2019t explain it.\nThe effort feels exhausting, the frustration builds,\nand sex starts to feel like a performance where you just don't get anywhere.\nOr maybe it is like the switch has been turned off.\u00a0 You use to feel the fire. The hunger. The craving. But not anymore and you don\u2019t know why.\u00a0It has been\nsssooo long since you\u00a0just had sex\nwith her any time, anywhere, anyhow. And this scares you.\nShe reaches for you, but you pull away avoiding intimacy\u00a0as you make excuses\nbecause the fear of failing again is worse than not trying at all.\nNot because you don\u2019t love her, but because you don\u2019t know how to explain what\u2019s happening.\u00a0 And\nwith every rejection, you feel the distance between you growing\nwider\n. You feel her disappointment and worry if she thinks less of you.\nThe frustration, the embarrassment, the guilt\u2014\nit\u2019s a cycle you can\u2019t seem to break.\nThe worst part is you feel as if you\u2019re letting both of you down as you ask again and again and again \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d\nWhat if I told you it does not have to be this way ?\nWhen you become a \"Man In Control\"\neverything changes\nYES I want that\nHere are some facts.\n\u2026\nToday the average man\nlasts only 4 min\nfrom penetration to ejaculation.\u00a0A woman's body needs 30 -40 minutes to become fully aroused, turned on and orgasmic.\nConstantly ejaculating\nweakens a man's vitality.\nPremature Ejaculation is a sign of our highly stressed times. It\u00a0does not have to be the norm and\nevery man can change it.\nMany acts of sex leave women feeling\ndissatisfied and distant\nfrom their partners.\nA mans power lies in his ejaculation choice. Not just in the bedroom but in\nall areas of his life.\nAre you ready to take control of your life from the inside out?\nMan in Control\nis a powerful, no-nonsense, short yet content rich, 4 module program designed to have you\nmaster your sexual energy\nand develop\nunshakable confidence\nin and outside of the bedroom\nGreat lovers are not born.\nThey are made.\n\"\nSometimes I would come earlier than I wanted and other times I could not come when I wanted to.\nAll that changed\nafter five weeks of lessons from Melissa.\n\"\n- Greg USA\nMelissa's program is nothing short of beautiful.\nBecoming more educated about my sexual energy has allowed me to better harness this power to increase my overall health, focus, and confidence.\nFor so long, I had taken part in unhealthy sexual practices\nbecause I had never been taught by parents, society or friends, what a healthy sex life really looks like.\u00a0 Something that Melissa said that has always stuck with me was that\n\"we are never taught how to be great lovers\".\nMelissa is the perfect teacher to help guide anyone on learning how to be that great lover!\n- Conner\u00a0USA\n\"\nIn her field and in life\nMelissa is one badass angel.\nShe has put my life on a whole new sexual and sensual trajectory for which I am eternally grateful\n\"\n-\u00a0Richard.

No more frustration or feeling\ndisappointed in myself.\u00a0 Instead I just feel my full presence and control. It is so awesome.\nMost men struggle with stamina in bed, but only a few actually do something about it.\nIf you\u2019re tired of hoping it gets better on its own, this is your answer.\nThese step-by-step audios will train your body, your breath, and your plea\nsure response\nso you can last longer, stay harder, and take charge of your performance\u2014like a man who knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. Are you ready to level up?\nThere\u2019s no shortage of information on lasting longer in bed, but let\u2019s be real\u2014reading about it won\u2019t change anything.\u00a0Most courses throw a bunch of concepts at you and expect you to figure it out on your own.\u00a0You need to train your body, not just fill your head with information.\nI am sure you have heard the advice\u2014\"Do your kegels,\" \"Control your breath,\" \"Be more present\"\u2014but no one actually shows you how.\u00a0What you need is clear, step-by-step training that teaches your body exactly how to build stamina, control arousal, and stay present in the moment.\nThis isn\u2019t just theory or vague tips; these audios walk you through each technique, guiding you in real-time so you can actually feel the difference.\nMastering stamina and control isn\u2019t just about knowing what to do. It is about doing it, consistently, with the right techniques. That\u2019s why real-time, guided instruction is the key to real results.\nMost men don\u2019t struggle because they lack knowledge. They struggle because they\u2019ve never been shown how to apply it in the moment. This training bridges that gap, taking you from theory to mastery.\nGet your training in real time now\nYES I want that\nHere are some facts.\n\u2026\nToday the average man\nlasts only 4 min\nfrom penetration to ejaculation.\u00a0A woman's body needs 30 -40 minutes to become fully aroused, turned on and orgasmic.\nConstantly ejaculating\nweakens a man's vitality.\nPremature Ejaculation is a sign of our highly stressed times. It\u00a0does not have to be the norm and\nevery man can change it.\nMany acts of sex leave women feeling\ndissatisfied and distant\nfrom their partners.\nA mans power lies in his ejaculation choice. Not just in the bedroom but in\nall areas of his life.\nIf you are ready to\u00a0do the practical steps whilst listening to my voice as I guide you step by step, then i can say there is no more inspiring way to do so than getting these audios.\nGreat lovers are not born.\nThey are made.\nI used to psych myself out before sex even started. The pressure to perform would get in my head, and that stress only made things worse.\nThese audios rewired the way I approach intimacy.\nThe exercises helped me build stamina and confidence, and now, for the first time in my life,\nI feel in control\ninstead of anxious\n-\u00a0Anthony New Zealand\nBefore practicing with these audios, sex always felt like I was in a race against time. I\u2019d be in my head, worried about finishing too soon, and I couldn\u2019t fully enjoy the moment.\nThey taught me how to slow down, control my pleasure, and actually be present with my partner.\nNow, I last longer, and sex has become more intimate and connected than ever before.\n- Jason USA\nI thought lasting longer was just about willpower, but the training in these audiso showed me it\u2019s actually a skill.\nThe combination of breathing, kegels, and learning my \u2018point of no return\u2019 completely changed the game.\nNow I can control my arousal instead of it controlling me, and the pleasure I feel has never been better. I had heard about this kind of thing before but was not so sure it was real, but now I get it\n-\u00a0Noah Switzerland\nGet the step by step audio trainings now and last longer in bed before\nyour next date\nYES  I want that\nThese\u00a0audios are for the men\u00a0who experience...\n\ud83c\udf46\u00a0 Difficulty\nmaintaining an erection\n\ud83c\udf46\u00a0 Premature ejaculation\n\ud83c\udf46\u00a0 Performance anxiety\n\ud83c\udf46\u00a0 Low sexual stamina\n\ud83c\udf46\u00a0 Lack of sexual confidence\n\ud83c\udf46\u00a0 Inconsistent sexual desire\n\ud83c\udf46\u00a0 Emotional disconnection during intimacy\n\ud83c\udf46\u00a0 Fear of sexual inadequacy\n\ud83c\udf46\u00a0 Stress-related sexual dysfunction\n\ud83c\udf46\u00a0 Porn-induced sexual challenges\n\ud83c\udf46\u00a0 Negative body image impacting sexual performance\n\ud83c\udf46\u00a0 Relationship intimacy issues\n\ud83c\udf46\u00a0 Reduced sexual sensitivity\n\ud83c\udf46\u00a0 Difficulty experiencing sexual pleasure\n\ud83c\udf46\u00a0 Mental distraction during sexual encounters\n\ud83c\udf46\u00a0 Low energy and vitality\n\ud83c\udf46\u00a0 Shame around sexual expression\n\ud83c\udf46.

Yet, the deepest truth is this:\nSurrender is the gateway to your power.\nNot power over\u2014but power within.\nThis is your invitation to a transformational 3-hour event, where you will be guided through three profound initiations of surrender.\nThis is for the woman who desires to feel deep trust\u2014in herself, in life, and in love.\nBefore she can fully surrender in the presence of a man, she must first feel the truth of surrender within her own body.\nWhat You Will Experience\nThis immersive experience will take you through three sacred processes designed to open you into deeper trust and feminine embodiment:\n1.\nSurrender to the truth felt in your body:\nBefore we can trust ourselves, we must feel ourselves. In this process, we will somatically move through the four core emotions\u2014anger, sadness, fear, and joy\u2014liberating them from the body so that we can hear the deeper wisdom beneath them. This is where you reclaim yourself, where you stop performing for the world and begin listening to the deepest truth within.\n2.\nSurrender to HER: The Universe:\nHow safe do you feel being held by others? How deeply do you trust the world around you? The process of life itself?\u00a0 In this practice, we explore the wounds and stories we carry around trusting other women, and how they impact our ability to surrender to the existence of life. To open to love, abundance, and divine flow, we must first heal the fractures of sisterhood and belonging.\n3.\nSurrender to the innate intelligence of your power:\nFinding Safety in Your Full Expression Power is not force. Power is not domination. True power is the ability to stand fully in your truth, unapologetically, and still feel safe. In this process, you will meet your edges, feel your full expression, and cultivate the deep nervous system safety required to trust yourself at your most powerful.\nWho is This For?\nThis is for the woman who:\n\u2728 Feels like she is holding onto control so tightly that she cannot breathe.\n\u2728 Desires to feel safe in her softness, her emotions, and her power.\n\u2728 Knows she is ready to trust herself and trust life more deeply.\n\u2728 Feels the call to open, soften, and surrender\u2014without losing herself.\nSaturday 1st March 3pm EET\u00a0 OnLine\n44 Euros\nGorgeous woman you are the sensuous nature of being itself.

rocket science.\nBut it does take practice.\nIf you're a man that is thinking that everyone else is able to have rock-hard erections and last a long time whilst you are one of the few that can\u2019t, well, you are wrong.\nMany men are just like you.\nYet you can be one of the few that actually does something about it.\nMen of action are sexy as f*ck.\nTake the first step today by joining

power of experiencing the conscious choice of choosing when how and with whom you ejaculate?\nIf the answer is yes, then\nJoin us here.\nMeet your Master Coach,\nMelissa Louise.\nOne of my claims to fame\u00a0is that I was hired by the owners of\nPenthouse in Sydney\n18 years ago to teach their girls how to make a man last longer so they would make more money !!!\nAnd they did !!\nI have been supporting men to understand the power and gift of their sexual energy ever since.\nI am a rebel, a world traveler, and I live life on my own terms.\nI am here to emancipate men from their deep shame and insecurities when it comes to the bedroom.\nSo they can own and harness the power of their cock so not only do they\nbecome the man who fucks his woman wide open, through her mind, heart, and pussy,\nbut also the man that is\nmore trustworthy, powerful, and knows more freedom\nby fully embodying his life rooted in his mission.\nAs an Erotic Blueprint Coach combining Tantric, Daoist, and Kink 101 teachings, I also bring my knowledge as a conscious breathwork facilitator,\u00a0 Accelerated Evolution coach, and training in Access consciousness.\nAbove all, I am an intuitive coach and healer.\nAn embodiment of the deepest feminine gift, \u201cthe felt sense.\u201d\nMy coaching brings you into the divine union of the masculine and feminine where you get to experience your sexual relationship as the place that nourishes you, not depletes you.\nMy mission is to support men to\u00a0know love\u00a0to have purpose and to be a legend.\nAt least in the bedroom that is.\nI have taught and spoken at public events in 8 different countries while supporting clients from all over the world with a 98% success rate.\nI make sure my clients that are willing to put in the work get what they want.\nWhat others are saying about me...\nJonny, England\nAfter working with Melissa for just a couple of weeks, she helped me to get clear on shedding my toxic (British) definitions of masculinity and how I had been depriving my partner of my full primal self...\nThe evening after our second session felt like a real revelation and led to one of our biggest relationship breakthroughs\u2014realizing how we had both been so conditioned by our families and upbringing to be 'NICE' rather than real, raw, truthful, wild and alive with each other\u2014and needless to say this new way of being led to some passionate and powerful experiences in the bedroom!\nBill, USA\nMelissa is an amazing fountain of knowledge with an amazing heart.\u00a0 She is excellent at adapting her coaching to your needs.\u00a0 The coaching she provides is truly life-changing.\nI am a better man in so many ways because of Melissa.\u00a0 Her coaching was so transformational in my life that I signed one of my adult sons up for coaching with her and intend to sign my other adult son up as well.\nConnor, USA\nMelissa's program is nothing short of beautiful.\nBecoming more educated about my sexual energy has allowed me to better harness this power to increase my overall health, focus, and confidence.\nMelissa is the perfect teacher to help guide anyone on learning how to be that great lover!\nThe program is LOADED with content and I would highly recommend it to absolutely anyone! \u00a0 Let Melissa be your guide on your sexual journey, you will not regret it.\nThibaut, France\nI can only use two words to describe my coaching experience with Melissa: Life-changing.\nWith Melissa's help, I have been able to completely express myself and express my desires to help people with their sexuality and be a part to end the taboo era around Sex.\nAs soon as I met her, I instantly felt the power and the potential of her communication and of her message.\nRichard, Costa Rica / USA\nIn her field and in life Melissa is one badass angel. She has put my life on a whole new sexual and sensual trajectory for which I am eternally grateful.\u201d\n\u201cI was working through some childhood trauma on allowing myself to receive from the feminine and pleasure. I knew the right person had come into my life.\nJoin us here, lover.",

    "content": "DEEPER RELATING\nwith Melissa Louise\nI\u2019m not sure words can sum up this wonderful woman! My husband and I have been having sessions with Melissa for over a month now and the changes within ourselves and our relationship is phenomenal! The connection to self, connection to each other is all back baby! Let\u2019s not forget the LOVE and understanding Melissa has helped us foster within ourselves, for each other and for our family! Her knowledge is delicious, always leaving you wanting more as it just makes SENSE & speaks to all the fibres of your being.\nDanielle. Australia\nHello Lover. I am your Sensuous Pleasure Advocate, Erotic Blue Print, Sex, Intimacy,\u00a0& Relationship Expert and t\nhis is my invitation to you and your beloved to\u00a0embark on an intimate journey into the deeper and more sensual corners of your relationship.\nThe quality of your intimate relationship is deeply intertwined with the fabric of your overall quality of life and is a fundamental aspect of your human nature. This relationship is your truest mirror that reflects your deepest needs, desires, and aspects of your true self which is why the dedication to its cultivation is of the utmost importance to your health, wealth and wellbeing.\nDeeper Relating\nwhich is my signature program previously only available to my private clients is an incredible framework to do just that. This program is inspired by the truth that t\nhe quality of your relationships profoundly influences the overall quality of your life.\nDeeper Relating is where you experience profound practices that foster and cultivate more connection, deeper honesty, trust building vulnerability, more safety and of course.....\nhotter sex.\nIf this is what you want, then...\nJoin here!\nIt is not about wether you are in a relationship or not, but rather it is more importantly about the\nquality\nof relationship you are in.\nThis\nlover\nis your invitation to\ndeepen\nand\nmagnify\nthe quality of yours.\nDEEPER\nRELATING\nDo you crave to\nconnect more intimately\nwith your beloved?\nHas life gotten in the way, and you find yourself feeling guilty that work and/or the kids have come between you and your partner, and the sexy has taken a back seat?\nAre you looking for ways to\nbring back the spark\nthat was there when you first met?\nAre you\nwondering where your libido has gone\nand worry that it is going to be like this from now on?\nAre you\nstruggling to even connect with one another\n, where old hurts, building resentments and unsaid words are getting in the way?\nDo you find yourself exasperated and a little lost when it comes to knowing how to approach the topics you desperately want to talk about\nbut fear rejection from your beloved?\nDo you find yourselves constantly fighting about the same things over and over again without resolution and\nfeeling stuck\nin the damaging loop of bickering?\nIf you answered yes to any of these then Lover, I've got you.\nAre you ready to experience the kind of pleasure, love, and connection that you often daydream about? Do you feel it is high time to learn communication tools that support you to have those\u00a0difficult (and sometimes tricky) conversations that actually create a closer connection between the two of you? Does your relationship deserve to be nourished by the two fo you having gourmet sex once again? If so then\nDeeper Relating\nis definitely for you.\n\"For our first session, Melissa created a very safe space for both of us to be vulnerable, and helped us to reveal parts of ourselves that needed so desperately to be shared, which is really saying something, as my partner and I have been in love for 8 years and we communicate & \u201cdive deep\u201d together as it is.\nIt was incredible to have Melissa there to push the envelope of vulnerability and sharing\u2026 she reminded us that our pleasure is our own right and responsibility, not each other\u2019s, and also provided us with practical ways to work through our own healing and our relationship, creating more space for love/sex/magic in the chaos of the world. Having practical advice for pleasurable experiences in life is possible, and Melissa provided us with this and so much more.\nI\u2019ve been singing her praises to my girlfriends, and even my guy friends, and I really believe that this powerhouse woman\u2019s insights could change the world as we know it.\u201d\n-Sarafina Fornara (Scottsdale, AZ)\nTo experience epic sex, which is the fundamental foundation and glue of what holds together deeply successful intimate relationships, you need to be cultivating an environment that is rooted in love, safety, and belonging.\nThis program is not about a list of tricks and positions to try in bed (although YES!.. there are a few of those as well!)\nIt is a deep and provocative journey into the inner fabric of your relating\nwhere lies the depth of your vulnerability, desire, sensuality, courage and playfulness.\nThe truth is that\nthe health of your intimate relationship profoundly affects your happiness, resilience, and even your growth as an individual. The fulfillment derived from a deeply meaningful, intimate relationship fuels your sense of belonging, purpose, and satisfaction in life. Thus, investing time and attention in the well-being of your intimate relationship is essential, as it leads to a life enriched with emotional and psychological well-being\nDeeper Relating\nis the perfect program if you are currently feeling disconnected to your beloved and are wanting to nourish your connection once again.\nDeeper Relating\nis the perfect program if you and your beloved are in a good place, but want something a little more.
