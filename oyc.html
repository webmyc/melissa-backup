I have searched for years to connect with the perfect person and Melissa you are that person.

There are not enough Thanks You's I can offer, as I got so much out of everything in this program.
Thank You! Thank You! Thank You! A Million, Gazillion times. Absolutely awesome.
So much gratitude to you Melissa.

Melissa definitely is a pro at creating safe, fun and colourful spaces in which she holds her programs. I can say without a doubt that I would recommend her work to anybody and everybody who is looking to learn more of the arts of pleasure, satisfaction, connection, and love.
My
Content Rich
program will teach you to take control of your sex life by lasting longer in bed, feeling more powerful, strengthen your erections, gain more freedom, increase your energy levels, and have you on the way to becoming
multi-orgasmic
!
IMAGINE THIS LOVER........
Your lover is hot for you, seeks you out and initiates sex because you can last for hours in bed with the confidence to turn her on & keep her there.
You have Raging Stamina, Core Confidence, Personal Power in your Ejaculation Choice, make More Money, be Strong in your Mission in life and are the guy she Trusts and Can't Get Enough of.
Your relationship is not depleting or deflating you, but instead nourishing you, fuelling your confidence and creativity. The sexual energy cultivated in your new relationship  is transmuting into your work, your mission and life goals leaving you feeling vibrant, alive and energized & full of desire.
This is the foundation of your freedom lover as t
he road to relationship and work genius consists of the development, control, and proper use of sex, love and romance.
If this is something you want
Become a man who
Occupies His Cock
and learn how to take control of your sexual vitality.
ENROLL NOW
We all come from sex.
…
It is the source of creation & the source of our life force energy.
Yet unfortunately, many men have been conditioned to throw it into the bin, treating it like a waste product as they continually deplete their bodies
Don’t get me wrong, I am not here to shame you for ejaculating.
Not at all.
The teachings inside of my infamous Occupy Your Cock program aim to support you to have ejaculation choice.
This is where your true power lies lover.
This is your rocket fuel.
"Destroy the sex glands; whether in a human being or a beast, and you have removed a major source of action." Napolean Hill
Freedom
is when you get to choose when, where and with whom you ejaculate.
When you cultivate your strong sexual energy it contributes to your vitality, creativity and overall sense of well-being.
"The individuals of greatest achievement tend to be those who have highly developed sexual natures and who have learned the art of sex transmutation."
Napolean Hill
Great lovers are not born.
They are made.
Do you answer yes to one or more of these questions?
Have you been avoiding intimacy because you believe you can’t truly satisfy your partner?
Feeling anxious when it comes to sex, afraid of cumming too quickly before your lover has even started?
Do you feel your advances are being rejected time and time again and find yourself wondering if your partner is avoiding sex and/or intimacy with you?
Have these types of setbacks stopped you from even trying to get close to your partner, & you are more housemates than lovers?
Are you with a woman whom has never experienced full body or ejaclatory orgasms and you want to be the one to take her there?
Are you a single man who has stopped dating so as not to be confronted with the issue of ot being able to last very long?
Do you feel the need to use alcohol or other substances for dutch courage to have sex?
Do you find yourself sharing excuses to your lover when you cum quickly that it is because you are tired? stressed? pre occupied?
Do you find yourself turning to porn more & more filling your solo sex life with shame, guilt & addiction?
Are you in a downward spiral of shame, exhaustion & resentment resulting in what is often called erectile dysfunction?
Are you and your partner bickering more and more whilst the intimacy and sex is getting less and less?
Does it feel like life, work, kids etc are all piling up and sex is the last thing on your mind?
Do you feel somewhat lost and not sure what your missio
n in life is and are done just going along with the crowd?
Do you have this niggling feeling that there is so much more to sex than than what is portrayed in the media and sports locker rooms?
Are you wanting to experience a deeply satisfying sex and intimate life with your partner but are unsure where to start?
A river may be dammed, and its water controlled for a time, but eventually it will force an outlet. The same is true of the emotion of sex. If it is not transmuted into some creative effort, it will find a less positive, less productive outlet.
Napolean Hill
How I see it, your cock is actually the barometer of your life and how we do one thing is how we everything
Instead of  viewing yourself as "having" erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation, everything changes when you realise your cock is functioning perfectly and is actually  trying to get your attention where things are not working. He is functionally telling you that something needs to change. Your highest potential as a man rests in cultivating your sexual energy, as this where lies your true power, as taught by the Doaist and Tantrics thousands of years ago.
The author of the book "Think Big, Grow Rich" also
knew of this power.
"
Sex desire is the most powerful of human desires
. When driven by this desire, men develop keenness of imagination, courage, willpower, persistence, and creative ability unknown to them at other times."
Napolean Hill
And now you can bring this into your own life and experience the benefits also.
Learning how to master your ejaculation means
...
You gain confidence in and outside of the bedroom becoming a better and more satisfying lover.
You last longer in bed gaining power by choosing when, how & with whom you ejaculate.
You experience yourself & your lover in so much more pleasure.
Your partner gets to experience the length of time she needs for her body to truly surrender allowing her to experience her true orgasmic potential.
Your masturbation practice fuels your body with energy instead of depleting it.
You have stronger erections
Your experience increased energy levels and a higher sex drive.
You become multi orgasmic
You make more money as you are harnessing sexual energy which is the creative energy of virtually all geniuses.
You experience a deeper connection to yourself and your partner
YES, I WANT IN!
Working with Melissa did more for our marriage than marital counselling.
If I had coaching with Melissa when I was in my 20’s it could have spared me a lot of fights and misunderstandings.

I'm Melissa Louise
18yrs ago
I
was hired by the owners of Penthouse in Sydney to teach their ladies how to make a man last longer so they would make more money! And they did.
As an Erotic Blueprint coach and your Pleasure Advocate
I am here to emancipate men from their deep shame & insecurities when it comes to the bedroom. So they can own and harness the power of their cock so not only do they become the man who fucks his woman wide open, through her mind, heart and pussy but also the man that is more trustworthy, powerful and knows more freedom by fully embodying his life rooted in his mission.
In my work I combine Tantric, Daoist & Kink 101 teachings, as well as bringing my knowledge as a Conscious Breathwork facilitator,  Accelerated Evolution coach and trainings in Access Consciousness into the sexy mix.
Above all, I am an intuitive coach and healer.
An embodiment of the deepest feminine gift, “The felt sense”
"
Melissa is an amazing fountain of knowledge with an amazing heart. She is excellent at adapting her coaching, which is truly life changing, to your needs. I am a better man in so many ways because of Melissa.
"

"
When I asked my wife the difference between sex before my coaching with Melissa compared to now.  She said, “It went from a good sprint to a marathon.”
- Bill USA
"
I can only use two words to describe my coaching experience with Melissa: Life-changing.
With Melissa's help, I have been able to completely express myself and express my desires to help people with their sexuality and be a part to end the taboo era around Sex."
- Thibaut France
"
Sometimes I would come earlier than I wanted and other times I could not come when I wanted to. All that changed after five weeks of lessons from Melissa.
"
- Greg USA
"
In her field and in life Melissa is one badass angel. She has put my life on a whole new sexual and sensual trajectory for which I am eternally grateful
"
- Richard. Costa Rica
"Melissa's program is nothing short of beautiful.
Becoming more educated about our sexual energy has allowed me to better harness this power to increase my overall health, focus, and confidence.  For so long, I had taken part in unhealthy sexual practices because I had never been taught by parents, society or friends, what a healthy sex life really looks like.  Something that Melissa said that has always stuck with me was that "we are never taught how to be great lovers".  Melissa is the perfect teacher to help guide anyone on learning how to be that great lover!
- Conner USA
It is time to stop shying away
from your greatness.
We live in a culture that has us too often believing a mans sexual energy is a dangerous part of him.
Yet the danger lies in the secrecy, the misinformation, the guilt and the silence that lingers around a man's sexual energy because he is not taught the ancient knowledge on how to harness it and use it in his life..
Know that your super power lies within your cock energy that supercharges your entire life.
Join Occupy Your Cock to claim your freedom & power & make more money by cultivating your sexual energy.
